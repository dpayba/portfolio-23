        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Dane Payba and I am a computer science student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a strong foundation in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web development. 
            I am projected in languages such as Python, C++, and Java and have experience with various technologies including TensorFlow, MongoDB, and Kubernetes. <br>
            I have gained valuable experience through internships at companies such as Google, KBR Inc, and Daily Bruin, where I have had the opportunity to develop software for scheduling tasks, implement methods for data retrieval, and create website redesigns. 
            In my current role as an incoming software engineering intern at Google, I am excited to continue learning and growing in my career.
        <br>
            In addition to my professional experience, I am passionate about using my projects to make a positive impact and have participated in extracurricular activities such as organizing robotics courses for elementary school students and managing multiple student-led projects.
        <br>
            I have also received recognition for my work, including being awarded the Hawaii Society of Professional Engineers Scholar in 2020 and placing first in the United States Congressional App Challenge in 2018.
       <br>
            Thank you for considering my profile. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or learn more about my education and experience.
